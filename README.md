# NN-Weather-Analysis
Many industries have the need to identify current and past weather conditions. The data helps them plan, organize, and/or optimize their operations. Using CNNs we are offering the potential to automate this by providing a digital eye. If an image recognition model could be built to identify conditions by looking at images of the weather, it could be deployed to automatically trigger smart devices. The dataset used in this project consists of 5,551 training images and 1,300 testing images. It has 11 classes representing different weather conditions, these classes are: dew, fogsmog, frost, glaze, hail, lightning, rain, rainbow, rime, sandstorm, snow.
